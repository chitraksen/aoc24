# Advent of Code 2024

Solving puzzles from AoC24, in OCaml. The purpose of this exercise is to learn the language. My solution on day 1 will be the first OCaml program I write. I am not trying to write the best or most efficient code, I am simply trying to learn a new (and my first functional) programming language, and this is one of the few ways that doesn't bore me to death.

# Usage

For the day 1 solution:

```bash
dune exec day1
```

Change to a different day number to run that solution instead.

Additionally, make sure your puzzle input is saved to `data/day1.txt` to get the day 1 solution. In case you save it elsewhere, edit the first line in `bin/day1.ml` to point to the correct file path.
